#Cureme : A platform that brings doctor,patients and pharmasists together</H1>

Due to various reasons in modern world, people get sick very often. Although some get very serious or chronic diseases more people get minor disease conditions. Instead of going to hospitals and following standard hospital procedures people have a practice of consulting a private doctor for themselves. In the modern busy world, consulting doctor for each and every minor matter like submitting a medical reports, medical advices and etc. has become a burden to the patients as well as doctors who have a very busy schedules. Since the patients have no idea of exact conditions to meet the doctor, doctor should guide them to find when it is necessary for them to look into them. So that the appointments should be created at an essential time with a collaboration between both parties.
Many Serious illnesses can be cured by early diagnosis, which is practically a problem. This can be done by a doctor who has track of earlier disease history records of their regular patients. Keeping track of the medical history of each and every patient is impossible for the doctors. An efficient mechanism of maintaining patient’s diseases history should be established in order to cure terminal diseases like Cancer, Leukemia and etc. by an early disease diagnosis.
